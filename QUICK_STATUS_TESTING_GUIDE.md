### **Test 3: Family Notification Integration**

#### **Setup Required**
- Two family members in same family (family code: 649091)
- Both users should have the updated app

#### **Test Family Notifications**
1. **Device A**: Update status using quick buttons
2. **Device B**: Should receive notification:
   - Title: "Family Status Update"
   - Body: "[Name] updated their status to '[Status]'"
3. **Console Logs**: Check for "Family notification sent for quick status update"

### **Test 4: Automatic Status Detection**

#### **Test Timer Setup** (For Development Testing)
*Note: Default timers are 24h/48h - for testing, you can modify AutoStatusService.js to use shorter intervals*

1. **Modify Timer Duration** (Optional for quick testing):
   ```javascript
   // In AutoStatusService.js, change:
   24 * 60 * 60 * 1000  // to: 2 * 60 * 1000 (2 minutes)
   ```

2. **Test Auto "Not Yet Responded"**:
   - Update status to "I'm Safe"
   - Wait for timer duration (24h or modified time)
   - Status should auto-change to "Not Yet Responded"
   - Console: "AutoStatusService - Auto updating status"

3. **Test Auto "Unknown"**:
   - Wait additional timer duration after "Not Yet Responded"
   - Status should auto-change to "Unknown"
   - Check for location activity factor

#### **Test Timer Reset**
1. Set status to "I'm Safe"
2. Wait briefly (don't let timer complete)
3. Manually update status to "Needs Help"
4. **Expected**: Timers should reset
5. **Console**: "AutoStatusService - Timers reset for user"

### **Test 5: Visual Consistency**

#### **Color Verification**
- **I'm Safe**: Green (#4CAF50) across all components
- **Needs Help**: Red (#F44336) across all components  
- **Evacuated**: Orange (#FF9800) across all components
- **Not Yet Responded**: Gray (#9E9E9E) - auto-set only
- **Unknown**: Dark Gray (#757575) - auto-set only

#### **UI Elements Check**
- Quick status buttons have proper shadows and elevation
- Current status display is readable
- Icons are properly aligned
- Buttons respond to touch with proper opacity changes

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **Quick Status Buttons Not Appearing**
- **Check**: Home.styles.js includes new quick status styles
