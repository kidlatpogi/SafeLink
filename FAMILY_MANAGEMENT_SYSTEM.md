# Family Management System

## Overview
SafeLink's family management system provides comprehensive controls for family creation, member management, and data preservation through archiving.

## Core Features

### 1. Firebase Document Structure
- **Document ID**: Family code (e.g., "589887") instead of random IDs
- **Direct Access**: `families/{familyCode}` for O(1) lookups
- **Archive System**: Soft deletion preserves data while preventing code reuse

### 2. Family Creation
- **Unique Code Generation**: 6-digit codes with collision detection
- **Archive Check**: Prevents reuse of codes from archived families
- **Admin Assignment**: Creator automatically becomes admin
- **Document Structure**:
```javascript
{
  code: "589887",
  createdAt: "2025-10-02T...",
  createdBy: "user123",
  isArchived: false,
  archivedAt: null,
  archivedBy: null,
  members: [...]
}
```

### 3. Member Management

#### Admin Capabilities (Family Creator Only):
- **Archive Family**: Soft delete with data preservation
- **Kick Members**: Remove members from family
- **Approve Removal Requests**: Handle member removal requests

#### Member Capabilities:
- **Request Removal**: Ask admin to be removed from family
- **Cancel Request**: Withdraw removal request
- **View Family Status**: See all family members and their safety status

### 4. Data Structure

#### Family Document:
```javascript
{
  code: "589887",
  createdAt: "2025-10-02T10:30:00.000Z",
  createdBy: "admin_user_id",
  isArchived: false,
  archivedAt: null,
  archivedBy: null,
  members: [
    {
      userId: "user_id",
      email: "user@example.com",
      name: "John Doe",
      isAdmin: true,
      joinedAt: "2025-10-02T10:30:00.000Z",
      status: "I'm Safe",
      lastUpdate: "2025-10-02T10:30:00.000Z",
      removalRequested: false,
      removalRequestedAt: null
    }
  ]
}
```

### 5. Archive System

#### Why Archive Instead of Delete:
- **Data Preservation**: Maintains family history and member information
- **Code Protection**: Prevents reuse of family codes until permanent deletion
- **Audit Trail**: Tracks who archived the family and when
- **Recovery Option**: Admins can potentially restore archived families

#### Archive Process:
1. Admin clicks "Archive Family"
2. Confirmation dialog with warning
3. Sets `isArchived: true, archivedAt: timestamp, archivedBy: adminId`
4. Family becomes inaccessible to all members
5. Family code cannot be reused for new families

### 6. User Interface

#### Family Members Display:
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded safety status bullets
- **Admin Badges**: Star icon for family administrators
- **Removal Requests**: Warning badges for pending requests
- **Action Buttons**: Context-sensitive remove/request buttons

#### Admin Controls:
- **Management Section**: Dedicated admin area with red theme
- **Pending Requests**: List of members requesting removal
- **Archive Button**: Prominent warning with confirmation
- **Removal Approval**: One-click approval of member requests

### 7. Security & Permissions

#### Admin Only Actions:
- Archive family
- Kick family members
- Approve removal requests

#### Member Only Actions:
- Request removal from family
- Cancel removal request

#### Restrictions:
- Members cannot leave family directly
- Admin cannot remove themselves (must archive family)
- Archived families cannot be joined
- Family codes from archived families cannot be reused

### 8. Error Handling

#### Validation Checks:
- User authentication required
- Admin permissions verified
- Family existence and archive status checked
- Proper member structure validation

#### User Feedback:
- Clear error messages for invalid actions
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
- Success notifications for completed actions
- Loading states during operations

## Implementation Benefits

1. **Performance**: Direct document access via family code
2. **Security**: Proper role-based access control
3. **Data Integrity**: Archive system preserves family history
4. **User Experience**: Clear visual indicators and intuitive controls
5. **Scalability**: Efficient Firebase queries and operations

## Usage Workflow

### For Family Creators:
1. Create family â†’ Get unique 6-digit code
2. Share code with family members
3. Monitor member requests in management section
4. Approve/deny removal requests
5. Archive family when no longer needed

### For Family Members:
1. Join family using shared code
2. View family member status
3. Request removal if needed
4. Wait for admin approval

This system provides a complete family management solution with proper data governance and user experience considerations.
